# Example License Scanner Config - Standalong Version
# use this config for running license-scanner across multiple repos at once
# this is useful for running big audits across the entire Mojaloop codebase

[environment]

title = "License Scanner Config"

##
# What mode should we run the scanner in?
# options:
# - "standalone": will run the tool against all repos listed in the `repos` list (below)
# - "local": will run the tool against the repo defined in `pathToRepo`
# - "docker": will run the tool against the docker image defined in `dockerImage`
mode = 'standalone'


# How we should process the licenses
# options are: 
# - "fossa-api": will export to fossa api (requires FOSSA_API_KEY to be set in .env)
# - "fossa-json": will export from fossa to a folder of json files. This just shows import heirarchies, and doesn't scan licenses
# - "lc-csv": will use npm license-checker, and export to a list of csv files
# - "lc-summary": will use npm license-checker, and export a summary file for each repo
tool = "lc-csv"


##
# The path to the repo that will be scanned
# Ignored when `mode != "local"`
#
# e.g.
# pathToRepo = "/Users/ldaly/developer/vessels/mojaloop-github/ml-api-adapter"
#
# Override by setting `pathToRepo` env variable
##
pathToRepo = ""

##
# The docker image to be scanned
#
# Ignored when `mode != "docker"`
# Override by setting `dockerImage` env variable
##
dockerImage = ''

##
# The list of repos to scan
# Lines starting with a # will be ignored
# Ignored when `mode = "local"`
