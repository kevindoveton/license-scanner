# License Scanner Config - CI Version
# use this config for running license_scanner as part of a CI workflow

##
# What mode should we run the scanner in?
# options:
# - "standalone": will run the tool against all repos listed in the `repos` list (below)
# - "ci": will run the tool against the repo defined in `pathToRepo`
# - "docker": will run the tool against the docker image defined in `dockerImage`
#TODO: fix abiguity in this - we can be in CI and docker at the same time...
mode = 'ci'
# mode = 'docker'

##
# How we should process the licenses
# options are: 
# - "fossa-api": will export to fossa api (requires FOSSA_API_KEY to be set in .env)
# - "fossa-json": will export from fossa to a folder of json files. This just shows import heirarchies, and doesn't scan licenses
# - "lc-csv": will use npm license-checker, and export to a list of csv files
# - "lc-summary": will use npm license-checker, and export a summary file for each repo
tool = "lc-csv"

##
# The path to the repo that will be scanned
# Ignored when `mode != "ci"`

# e.g.
# pathToRepo = "/Users/ldaly/developer/vessels/mojaloop-github/ml-api-adapter"
#
# Override by setting `pathToRepo` env variable

# excludeListTest = ["z-schema@3.25.1"]
#
# will ignore z-schema@3.25.1 in the license check
